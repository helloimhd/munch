Pre Project Materials:

## Concept Design
	Raining Fruits 
		You can move the bar left and right, while collecting  the "raining" fruits. 
		Avoid stuff that are not fruits, if not GAME OVER 


## User Stories
Create four user stories that apply to the functionality for your idea, following what we learned in class.

	As a juice maker, I want to collect as many fruits as I can 
	At the market 
	There are rotten fruits and of course you want to avoid it
